- 👋 Hi, I’m @NellekeM
- 👀 I’m interested in creativity, logic, mathematics, and some coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Applied Mathematics at TU Delft
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on sharing the beautiness of maths and logic with others, while using creativity (and coding)
- 📫 How to reach me: Is there a chat function on Github?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I know all powers of 2 up to 2^20=1048576 and many squares (up to 36), see it like other people learn \pi or rubics cube algorithms
